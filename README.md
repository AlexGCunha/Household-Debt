# **Codes for Household debt project**
**Please, note that this project is not yet over. We remain to finish the dataset creation and run regressions.**

The main goal of this project is to analyse the heterogeneous effect of job dipslacement (through a mass layoff) on carrer outcomes for people with distinct levels of debt before layoff.
That is, we expect that individuals with higher debt levels will be in more need to find a new (formal) job quickly, independetly if the job is the best one she could get or not. On the other hand, non-finacially distressed individuals could wait a bit longer and maybe are reemployed in better jobs after layoff.
